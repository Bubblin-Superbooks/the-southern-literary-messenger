<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>By Frederic Speece.</p><p>O, they were rose-buds, fresh and bright, Fair flow'rets breathing of delight; Young cherubs from a happier sphere, Too gently sweet to linger here.</p><p>The rose-buds withered ere their bloom, The flow'rets strewed an early tomb, The gentle cherubs tasted pain, Then sought their native skies again.</p><p>Infants are bright immortal things Though robed in feeble, dying clay: Death but unfolds their silken wings, And speeds their joyful flight away;</p><p>Beyond these cold, sublunar skies, They seek a home among the blest; On strong unwearied pinions rise, Cleave the blue vault and are at rest.</p><p>What though no marble may attest Where slumber lone their cold remains, Their little cares are hushed to rest, And terminated all their pains.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line">Nor Fame may deign a feeble blast, To tell the world that <em>they have been</em>; Nor snatch the record of the past</p></div> </div>
