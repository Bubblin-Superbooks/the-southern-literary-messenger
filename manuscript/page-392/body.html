Philadelphia: Carey, Lea & Blanchard. 1835.</p><p>Like "Our Village," these are delightful productions, abounding with wholesome satire of folly and prejudice, and displaying in strong relief the humble virtues of retired life. Some of the characters are conceptions of great loveliness, and many of the scenes are wrought with most pathetic effect. The story of Hester is admirable. We have seldom dwelt with more delighted interest over a picture of juvenile virtue and self-devotion.</p><p>EDITORIAL REMARKS.</p><p>We have but a few words to offer upon the contents of the present number. Generally they must speak for themselves; but in regard to others we may be permitted a passing comment.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line">No. II of the Dissertation on the characteristic</p></div> </div>
