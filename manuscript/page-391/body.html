<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>MY LIFE, by the author of Tales of Waterloo, &c. New York: Harper & Brothers. 1835.</p><p>This is the production of a lively and spirited writer. He describes skirmishes, onslaughts and battles, with the familiarity of one who has not seldom taken a part in such actionsâ€”traces the Irish character with great fidelity, and best of all, his book abounds in humorous incidents. The <em>contre-pieds</em> between the hero and his cousin, "Jack the Devil," are admirably detailed. Jack is a rare specimen of the Wild Irishman, and we have seldom been more amused than we were with the history of the scrapes in which he involved himself and his cousin. The battle of Waterloo is sketched briefly, but with a graphic pen. The last struggle of that day, when Ney led the Old Guard to the charge, and the description of the "field red with slaughter," after the work of death had concluded, give evidence of the painting of an eye-witness.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
