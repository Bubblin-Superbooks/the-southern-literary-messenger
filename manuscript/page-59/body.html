But when I look, dear girls on ye, E'en in the look my worlds I see; No vow has passed—our years have proved That we have ever truly loved— And in your every prayer I hear, My name so kindly whispered there, Oh! then I <em>love</em>.</p><p>ROSICRUCIUS.</p><hr class="section"><p>For the Southern Literary Messenger.</p><p>LINES.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line">Sleep on, thou dear maiden, I'll guard thee from harm, No foe shall come nigh thee while strength's in this arm; As thy sweet breath comes o'er me wild wishes may rise, But honor still whispers—Remember the ties</p></div> </div>
