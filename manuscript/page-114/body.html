Unfit for this world or another, You're forced to be married or killed— The lady you choose—or her brother— And a grave—or a paragraph's filled.</p><p>True Love is at home among flowers, And if he would dine at his ease, A capon's as good in his bowers As in rooms heated ninety degrees: On sighs intermingled he hovers, He foots it as light as he flies, His arrows, the glances of lovers, Are shot to the heart from the eyes!</p><hr class="section"><p>For the Southern Literary Messenger.</p></div> </div>
