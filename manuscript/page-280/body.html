LACEY BEARD.</p><pre>Sunset is past,—and now while all is still,</pre><p>And softly o'er the plain the moonbeams fall, I'll hold communion with myself and call From mem'ry's caverns, feelings deep, that fill My soul with gladness…. Now I feel the thrill Of past delights;—I stand in that old hall, My friends surround me,—yes, I see them all:— My heart grows faint, my eyes with tear-drops fill.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line">And now they vanish, from my sight they go. Farewell ye loved ones, we shall meet again As oft we've met, at the dim twilight's wane;— In dreams and visions which shall brightly show Your sunny faces, and shall bring the glow Of by-gone joys, back to my soul</p></div> </div>
